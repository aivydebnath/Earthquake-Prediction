# Earthquake-Prediction

## Objective:

Earthquakes are powerful natural events that can result in extensive harm and loss of lives. To protect people and property, it's crucial to be able to predict when and where earthquakes might happen. This project's goal is to forecast the size and likelihood of an earthquake occurring in a specific area, like California in the United States. We're going to do this by analyzing past data from that region, using different machine-learning models.
