# Earthquake-Prediction

## Objective:

Earthquakes are powerful natural events that can result in extensive harm and loss of lives. To protect people and property, it's crucial to be able to predict when and where earthquakes might happen. This project's goal is to forecast the size and likelihood of an earthquake occurring in a specific area, like California in the United States. We're going to do this by analyzing past data from that region, using different machine-learning models.


## Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, earthquake magnitude) and one or more independent variables (in this case, latitude, longitude, depth, and the number of seismic stations that recorded the earthquake).


## Naive Bayes:
In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the simplest Bayesian network models,[1] but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels.


## Random Forest:
Random forest is a machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and robust model.

## Conclusion:

Both the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score serve as valuable metrics for assessing model performance. In general, a superior model is characterized by a lower MSE and a higher R2 score. This is primarily due to the MSE's role in quantifying the average disparity between predicted and actual values; a lower MSE signifies a model that is making more precise predictions. On the other hand, the R2 score evaluates a model's ability to elucidate the proportion of variance in the target variable, with a higher R2 score indicating a greater capacity to account for variability in the said variable. From the results of this project, it can be deduced that the Random Forest model outperforms all other models in predicting earthquake magnitude accurately.
